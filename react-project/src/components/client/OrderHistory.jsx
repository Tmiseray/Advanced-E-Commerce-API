    - Manage Order History (Bonus): Create a component that allows customers to access their order history, listing all previous orders placed. Each order entry should provide comprehensive information, including the order date and associated products.
    - Cancel Order (Bonus): Implement an order cancellation feature, allowing customers to cancel an order if it hasn't been shipped or completed. Ensure that canceled orders are appropriately reflected in the system.
    - Calculate Order Total Price (Bonus): Include a component that calculates the total price of items in a specific order, considering the prices of the products included in the order. This calculation should be specific to each customer and each order, providing accurate pricing information.
